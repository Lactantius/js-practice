// var can be redeclared and is scoped to functions, or, if global, is attached to the window object.
// let cannot be redeclared, is scoped to blocks, and is not attached to the window object if global.
// const is like let, but cannot be redefined (although objects bound to it may (usually) be modified)
// Hoisting is when variable declarations are interpreted before other elements. Only works with var.
